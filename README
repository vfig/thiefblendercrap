# ThiefTools blender plugin
Version 0.0.2 (alpha)

For Blender 2.90 or later.

## Installing:

1. Download the code as a zip from github.

2. In Blender, go to `Edit > Preferences > Addons`. Click `Install...` and select the zip file. Make sure the checkbox beside the addon is ticked.

3. Click the small triangle beside the checkbox to open the addon preferences. In `Resource Path 0` and `Resource Path 1`, put the paths to your Thief Gold and Thief II resource folders.

**Note: v0.0.1 (alpha) does not yet support loading terrain textures from fam.crf**. To use the mission importer, you must extract fam.crf yourself (with Windows Explorer or any unzip tool); the paths you provide in step 3 should be to the parent folder, that contains the extracted subfolder `fam`.

## Importing a mission

Go to `File > Import > Thief Mission (.mis)`. Select your mission and click `Import .MIS`.

Options:

  * Skip Jorge: don't create geometry for brush faces with Jorge texture.
  * Skip SKY HACK: don't create geometry for brush faces with SKY HACK texture.

You should use Material Preview or Rendered mode to see textures and lightmaps in the 3D viewport. In Solid mode you can see unlit textures only, if you set the `Color` option to `Texture`.

Textures that are in .PCX or .GIF format will be packed into the .blend file; textures that are in .PNG, .JPG, or .TGA format will not. Textures in .DDS format are not yet supported.

### Post-import settings

In the Object Properties tab, scroll down to find `Thief: Mission Settings`.

  * Textures: toggle muting of terrain texture material nodes.
  * Lightmaps: toggle muting of lightmap material nodes.
  * Texture Filtering: toggle Linear/Closest filtering in terrain texture material nodes.
  * Lightmap Filtering: toggle Linear/Closest filtering in lightmap material nodes.
  * Brightness: a hack to make lightmaps brighter so the level is more visible in the viewport/render.

## Baking textures and lightmaps together

This feature is intended for creating objects from imported level geometry. For example, you might want to replace distant, unreachable buildings with a single object to improve render performance.

You should first create the geometry with lighting that you want in Dromed, then import the .MIS into Blender.

1. In the 3D Viewport, press `N` to show the context panel, and select the `Thief` tab.

2. Select your imported mission object.

3. Click `Bake together`.

This will create a copy of the object (suffixed '.baked') with a single material that has terrain textures and lightmaps baked into a single texture.

You can then use Blender Newdark Toolkit to export this object as a .bin for use in Dromed. You should set the `Renderer > Render Type` property in Dromed to `Unlit` so that the model appears lit with the baked lightmaps.

Note: because this allocates unique texture space to every brush face, lots of geometry or higher lightmap resolutions may exceed the space available for baking in a 4K texture. This addon does not yet support making multiple textures when baking, so you will have to edit the geometry into smaller sections yourself if needed before baking.
