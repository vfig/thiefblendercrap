WEIGHTS

so i think _for now_ i can maybe ignore the weights on the import side?

i believe all they are is a precomputed influence factor, to ramp up the child bone's influence at a joint. if that is the case, i should look for a relatively simple mesh [where we know the _actual_ limit planes] with a stretchy segment (player arm? blackjack?), and try to generate the same weights (within tolerance).


EASY WINS

uvs and material (texture)


MORE COMPLICATED

material flags
normals (poly normals vs vertex normals??)
