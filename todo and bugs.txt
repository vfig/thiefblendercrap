toggle jorge, sky_hack
toggle backface culling
remember last folder
is jorge, sky_hack lightmapped? (yes)
lightmaps or textures break when importing a lot? (blender bug? throwing away pixel data? idk) -- happens when i mute the nodes. i think blender is trying to save memory by unloading the images, assuming it can load them back when needed? i guess i need to fakeuser and pack them?
delete air portal vertices
load textures from crf
pack .gif/.pcx images
support .vbr, .cow
paths for resources
jorge shader
sky_hack shader
