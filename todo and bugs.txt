toggle jorge, sky_hack
    -> does this mean toggle alpha clip/0 alpha?
    -> toggle import of them, even!

jorge shader?
sky_hack shader?

is jorge, sky_hack lightmapped? (yes)
    -> default to skipping their lightmaps, they dont need them?
       and the _biggest_ single atlas space users (in t2) are sky polys.

toggle backface culling
    -> for all the materials of the level

support animlights
    -> option to bake them into the atlas during import?
    -> or option for second animlight-only atlas?
    -> or three atlases: static, default-on-animlight, default-off-animlight?
